    <h2>🚖 NYC Taxi Dashboard</h2>
    <p>
      This section explores key trends from the NYC Yellow, Green, and For-Hire Vehicle (FHV) taxi datasets 
      for January 2015. I analyze demand across boroughs, fare structures, peak hours, and most traveled 
      zones, helping us understand commuter behavior and urban mobility patterns.

  <!-- Key Insights -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>💡 Key Insights</h2>
    <p>
      • Manhattan had the highest yellow taxi usage, accounting for over 92% of total trips.<br>
      • Midtown Center was the top pickup location for FHVs.<br>
      • Friday saw the highest taxi and flight activity, indicating weekly travel peaks.<br>
      • The average fare for green taxis was $11.77 and for yellow taxis around $82.53 in some high-fare zones.<br>
      • Weather conditions significantly impacted trip durations and delays, with colder days showing reduced mobility.
    </p>

  <!-- New Storytelling Sections -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>🗺️ Borough-Level Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      This section focuses on how taxi demand and fare patterns vary across NYC boroughs. 
      Manhattan consistently leads in taxi usage, with over 92% of yellow taxi trips. In contrast, Staten Island 
      sees minimal demand. For-Hire Vehicle (FHV) data shows Midtown Center as the most active pickup zone. 
      The analysis also reveals fare disparities, with neighborhoods like Charleston/Tootenville showing the 
      highest average fares.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>📆 Weekday vs Weekend Behavior</h2>
    <p>
      Travel behavior shifts significantly between weekdays and weekends. Data shows Friday as the busiest 
      day for both flights and taxis, with weekday mornings seeing higher average fares. Yellow taxi demand 
      peaks early mornings, while FHV demand increases on weekends. Week 5’s Friday alone accounts for 
      6.32% of green taxi demand. Weekend activity is more evenly distributed among boroughs.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🌡️ Weather Impact</h2>
    <p>
      Weather conditions had a measurable impact on NYC's mobility. As temperatures dropped from Jan 1 to Jan 31, 
      both minimum and maximum temperatures showed steep declines. Temperature variance between “feels like” 
      and actual temperatures was highest around 2 AM. The coldest days saw reduced taxi demand and 
      increased flight delays, suggesting weather was a significant disruptor.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>✈️ Flight Delay & Cancellation Trends</h2>
    <p>
      The analysis revealed that flight delays and cancellations peaked on Mondays, while Fridays had the fewest. 
      Southwest Airlines had the highest number of delays (42,195), and Dallas/Fort Worth Airport experienced the 
      most cancellations (3,578). Delay patterns align with weather and weekday behavior, while cancellations 
      diverged most during January. A noticeable gap between delays and cancellations highlights complex 
      operational dynamics in NYC airports.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🧪 Hypothesis Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Several hypotheses were tested to better understand correlations. For instance, we found:
      <ul>
        <li>Flight delays increase when weather is "snow" or "rain."</li>
        <li>Taxi fares are marginally higher on weekends, especially during peak evening hours.</li>
        <li>Arrival and departure delays are positively correlated, indicating cascading schedule effects.</li>
      </ul>
      These insights were explored using filters across airline, weather condition, and date dimensions in Power BI.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>📊 Anomaly Detection</h2>
    <p>
      This section highlights unusual values and outliers:
      <ul>
        <li>🚖 Max fare: $4,008 (Yellow Taxi)</li>
        <li>🕒 Max trip duration: 549,000 minutes</li>
        <li>🌡️ Coldest temperature: -16.5°C | Feels like: -27.1°C</li>
        <li>🛫 Min flight distance: 31 miles | Min arrival delay: -82 mins</li>
      </ul>
      Anomaly flags helped uncover errors, extreme use cases, and data quality concerns, particularly in FHV datasets.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🔗 How It’s Connected</h2>
    <p>
      This project brings together three distinct datasets: taxi trips, weather, and flight operations. 
      Relationships were established via date, location IDs, and weather conditions to allow cross-domain analysis. 
      For example:
      <ul>
        <li>Taxi pickup dates align with weather data to assess weather impacts on demand.</li>
        <li>Flight delays are analyzed against airport origin and daily weather.</li>
        <li>FHV trip data includes weather joins for contextual analysis despite missing drop-off details.</li>
      </ul>
      These connections enable a rich, narrative-driven exploration of how transportation systems interact with 
      environmental and temporal factors in a major urban setting.

  <div class="section">
    <h2>📘 NYC Data Analytics & Insights Report</h2>
    <p>
      Dive into our comprehensive analysis of New York City's transportation, weather, and flight data from January 2015. 
      This report weaves together data visualizations and narrative insights to uncover patterns, highlight challenges, 
      and tell the story of how the city moved, adapted, and responded during a single transformative month.
    </p>

    <p>

    <h2>🧠 Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      This project demonstrates the power of <strong>data integration</strong> and <strong>visual storytelling</strong> using Power BI. 
      Tools used include Excel for preprocessing, DAX for modeling, and Power BI for dynamic dashboard creation.
      The process involved cleaning multiple large datasets, establishing relationships between them, and crafting
      intuitive visualizations to guide user understanding. The result is a rich, narrative-driven analytical product
      that offers both depth and clarity.
